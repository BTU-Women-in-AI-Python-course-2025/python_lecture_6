# Abstraction in Python

Abstraction is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features or functionalities of an object. Abstraction allows you to focus on **what an object does** rather than **how it does it**.

---

## Why Use Abstraction?

1. **Simplifies Complexity**: Hides the internal complexity of a system, making it easier to use.
2. **Improves Maintainability**: Changes to the internal implementation do not affect the external interface.
3. **Enhances Reusability**: Abstract classes and methods can be reused across different parts of a program.
4. **Promotes Modularity**: Encourages the separation of concerns by breaking down a system into manageable components.

## Abstraction in Python

Python does not have built-in support for abstract classes like some other languages (e.g., Java). However, abstraction can be achieved using:
1. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**: Using the `abc` module to define abstract classes and methods.
2. **Interfaces**: Defining a set of methods that must be implemented by subclasses (though Python does not have explicit interfaces, ABCs can serve this purpose).

---

## Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)

Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) are classes that cannot be instantiated directly. They are meant to be subclassed, and they define one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by the subclasses.

### Example: Using ABCs for Abstraction

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass  # Abstract method (no implementation)

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass  # Abstract method (no implementation)
```

### Subclassing the Abstract Class

```python
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side

    def area(self):
        return self.side ** 2

    def perimeter(self):
        return 4 * self.side
```

### Using the Subclasses

```python
# Create objects of the subclasses
circle = Circle(5)
square = Square(4)

# Call methods
print(f"Circle Area: {circle.area()}")          # Output: Circle Area: 78.5
print(f"Circle Perimeter: {circle.perimeter()}") # Output: Circle Perimeter: 31.4

print(f"Square Area: {square.area()}")          # Output: Square Area: 16
print(f"Square Perimeter: {square.perimeter()}") # Output: Square Perimeter: 16
```

## Key Points About Abstract Classes

1. **Cannot Instantiate Abstract Classes**: Attempting to create an object of an abstract class will raise an error.
   ```python
   shape = Shape()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Shape
   ```
2. **Must Implement Abstract Methods**: Subclasses must implement all abstract methods defined in the abstract class.
3. **Can Have Concrete Methods**: Abstract classes can also include regular (concrete) methods with implementations.

## Real-World Example: Abstraction in a Payment System

Letâ€™s create an abstract class `PaymentGateway` to represent different payment methods.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class
class PaymentGateway(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def refund_payment(self, amount):
        pass

# Subclass for Credit Card payments
class CreditCardPayment(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        return f"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}."

    def refund_payment(self, amount):
        return f"Refunding credit card payment of ${amount}."

# Subclass for PayPal payments
class PayPalPayment(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        return f"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}."

    def refund_payment(self, amount):
        return f"Refunding PayPal payment of ${amount}."
```

### Using the Payment System

```python
# Create objects of the subclasses
credit_card = CreditCardPayment()
paypal = PayPalPayment()

# Process payments
print(credit_card.process_payment(100))  # Output: Processing credit card payment of $100.
print(paypal.process_payment(50))        # Output: Processing PayPal payment of $50.

# Refund payments
print(credit_card.refund_payment(20))   # Output: Refunding credit card payment of $20.
print(paypal.refund_payment(10))        # Output: Refunding PayPal payment of $10.
```

## Abstraction vs Encapsulation

While abstraction and encapsulation are closely related, they serve different purposes:
- **Abstraction**: Focuses on hiding the internal implementation and exposing only the necessary features.
- **Encapsulation**: Focuses on bundling data and methods into a single unit and restricting access to some components.

---

## Best Practices for Abstraction

1. **Use ABCs for Defining Interfaces**: Use abstract classes to define a clear interface for subclasses.
2. **Keep Abstract Methods Minimal**: Define only the essential methods in the abstract class.
3. **Document Your Abstract Classes**: Clearly document the purpose and usage of abstract classes and methods.
4. **Avoid Over-Abstraction**: Use abstraction only when it simplifies the design and improves readability.

---

## Conclusion

Abstraction is a powerful concept in OOP that helps you manage complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. By using **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** and **interfaces**, you can create flexible and maintainable code. Practice abstraction in your projects to build systems that are easy to understand and extend!
